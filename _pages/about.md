I am a Ph.D. student of Computer Science at University of Texas at Austin. I am very honored to be advised by <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/">Prof. Peter Stone</a>. I have general interests in reinforcement learning, meta learning, curriculum learning, and their applicaitons in robotics. My primiary focus is to apply deep reinforcement learning for mobile robot autonomous navigation.

Before I started the CS program, I recieved master's and bachelor's degrees in Physics, but was lucky to find my passion in artificial intellegence. Feel free to reach out to me if you are curious about my experience and research!
