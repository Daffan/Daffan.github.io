I am a Ph.D. student of Computer Science at University of Texas at Austin. I am very honored to be advised by <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/">Prof. Peter Stone</a>. I have general interests in reinforcement learning, multitask learning, curriculum learning, and their applicaitons in robotics. My primiary focus is to apply deep reinforcement learning for learning agile and diverse motor skills for legged comotion and autonomous navigation.
